From the summary of sales price in staten island we observed that there were a lot of missing values 

We performed data clean up on the sales price & sqft columns to eliminate these missing values

We eliminated irrevalant data prices (prices having NA , $-)

For our analysis we considered only the family dwellings

We eliminated the outliers - sales price less than 100K

Plotted sqft vs sales price graph. Since this was right skewed we plotted the log transformation

Based on the analysis we find a strong linear co-relation b/w sale price and sqft.
