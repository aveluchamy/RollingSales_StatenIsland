##This R markdown is created to demonstrate Collaboration and Versioning as explained in Unit 4.This group project involves working on a data set to analyze the real estate property prices in Staten Island and develop meaningful insights about the sale price of Family Dwellings.

```{r}
#First Start off by by loading the Plyr Library
## It is and R package that allows easy manipulation of large data set  by manipulating data values and putting it back together.
library(plyr)
#Next step is to create a new R Project and setting the working directory to a directory/folder on your local machine Where the Project files will be organized.
setwd("C:\\Users\\samaresh\\SMU\\Doing Datascience\\week4\\RollinSales_Staten")
#Read the Staten Island data file after saving it as a csv
staten <- read.csv("Data/rollingsales_statenisland.csv",skip=4,header=TRUE)
#Exploratory data analysis by looking at the summary data 
head(staten)
summary(staten)
str(staten)
#Data Cleanup to eliminate spaces and getting rid of leading digits
staten$SALE.PRICE.N <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", staten$SALE.PRICE))
count(is.na(staten$SALE.PRICE.N))
names(staten) <- tolower(names(staten)) # make all variable names lower case
staten$gross.sqft <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", staten$gross.square.feet))
staten$land.sqft <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", staten$land.square.feet))
staten$year.built <- as.numeric(as.character(staten$year.built))

## analysing the subject of interest which is the Sales Price
attach(staten)
hist(sale.price.n) 
detach(staten)

## Eliminate all the 0$ sales
staten.sale <- staten[staten$sale.price.n!=0,]
## Plot the Sqft vs Sales Price
plot(staten.sale$gross.sqft,staten.sale$sale.price.n)
## Since the graph is right skewed we will do a log transformation
plot(log10(staten.sale$gross.sqft),log10(staten.sale$sale.price.n))

## Analysing sale price of family dwellings
staten.homes <- staten.sale[which(grepl("FAMILY",staten.sale$building.class.category)),]
dim(staten.homes)
## Plot the Sqft vs Sales Price for family dwellings after log transformation
plot(log10(staten.homes$gross.sqft),log10(staten.homes$sale.price.n))
##Analyse the outliers
summary(staten.homes[which(staten.homes$sale.price.n<100000),])


## outliers that seem like they weren't actual sales
staten.homes$outliers <- (log10(staten.homes$sale.price.n) <=5) + 0
## remove outliers that seem like they weren't actual sales
staten.homes <- staten.homes[which(staten.homes$outliers==0),]
## plot the sqft vs sales price for family dwellings above 100K
plot(log(staten.homes$gross.sqft),log(staten.homes$sale.price.n))


##Histogram to analyse the sales price for family dwellings after removing outliers 
hist(staten.homes$sale.price.n)
##Histogram to analyse the sales price for family dwellings after removing outliers after log transformation as the above is right skewed
hist(log10(staten.homes$sale.price.n))
#display the mean sale price and mark it on the histogram in blue
mx <-  mean(log10(staten.homes$sale.price.n))
abline(v = mx, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
#display the mean sale price and mark it on the histogram in red
medx <- median(log10(staten.homes$sale.price.n))
abline(v = medx, col = "red", lwd = 0.1)
```
